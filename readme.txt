For Seamus and Leo:
    - Everytime you open this repository as a VSCode project, run "/.venv/Scripts/activate" in the
      integrated terminal to activate the virtual environment (venv) for running the scripts
    - If the requirements have changed since last time, or just as good practice, in the venv,
      run "pip install -r requirements.txt"
    - Everytime you pip install in the venv, afterwards, run "pip freeze > requirements.txt"
      to sync installed files across computers, and push requirements.txt to the repo
