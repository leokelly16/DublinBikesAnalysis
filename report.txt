1) Research Question:

	How does time of day affect bike availability at stations near Trinity?

	This question is useful for Trinity students who use Dublin Bikes as 
	a commuting option to know whether they will be likely to find a bike at
	peak times.


2) Data Selection:
	
	Stations:
		21 (Leinster Street South)
		22 (Townsend Street)
		27 (Molesworth Street)
		32 (Pearse Street)
		98 (Frederick Street South)

	Time Period:
		January 2022 - December 2023

	Filters:
		'Morning peak' = 7:00 - 10:59
		'Midday' = 11:00 - 15:59
		'Evening peak' = 16:00 - 19:59
		'Night' = 20:00 - 23:59
		'Overnight' = 00:00 - 6:59

3) Probability Analysis:
	Random Variables:
		Percentage of bikes available 


5) Results:
	Our results show that stations near Trinity are relatively empty 
	during the night, and begin to fill up gradually throughout the
	morning, peaking at midday. After the midday peak, the number of
	bikes slowly dwindles over the course of the evening, before
	stabilising after midnight. 
	This suggests that people commute with bikes from stations elsewhere 
	and dock them at stations near Trinity, resulting in a
	steady increase of bikes available over the course of the morning.
	The availability of bikes is relatively stable
