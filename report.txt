1) Research Question:

	How does time of day affect bike availability at stations near Trinity?

	This question is useful for Trinity students who use Dublin Bikes as 
	a commuting option to know whether they will be likely to find a bike at
	peak times.


2) Data Selection:
	
	Stations:
		21 (Leinster Street South)
		22 (Townsend Street)
		27 (Molesworth Street)
		32 (Pearse Street)
		98 (Frederick Street South)

	Time Period:
		January 2023 - December 2023

3) Probability Analysis:
	Random Variables:
		Percentage of bikes available


5) Results:
	Our results show that stations near Trinity are relatively empty 
	during the night, and begin to fill up gradually throughout the
	morning, peaking at midday. After the midday peak, the number of
	bikes slowly dwindles over the course of the evening, before
	stabilising after midnight. 
	This suggests that people commute with bikes from stations elsewhere 
	and dock them at stations near Trinity.
	The availability of bikes is remains high throughout the afternoon,
	perhaps suggesting a drop in usage during those times.
	Something interesting shown in the main graph is the very narrow variance
	around 17:00. We have observed Dublin Bikes vans resupplying stations
	with bikes throughout the day, so a possible reason for the low variance 
	during 5pm rush hour is a focused effort by Dublin Bikes to maintain a
	steady supply of bikes.



6) Reflect on assumptions:

Dublin Bikes bringing in bikes in trucks etc.

Most of our ideas for research questions centred around 'bike usage', 
however we soon discovered
